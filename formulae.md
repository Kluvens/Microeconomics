## Formulaes
Total cost = 

Marginal cost = change of total cost / change of quantity

Elasticity = (change of quantity / quantity) / (change of price / price)
or 
Elasticity = Price/Quantity * (1/slope)

And slope: slope = rise/run

## Principles
### Cost-Benefit Principle
If the marginal benefit (MB) is greater than or equal to the marginal cost (MC) 

In the short run, there are fixed costs and variable costs
- producers must at least cover their variable costs in the short run
- this means they aren't actively 

Price elasticity determinants
- availability of raw materials
- factors mobility
- inventories/excess capacity
- time horizon (time you can response)
