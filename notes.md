## Chapter 1
Absolute advantage: carry activities with the lowest amount of resources

Comparative advantage: carry activities with lower opportunity costs

If two people have the same opportunity cost, then they don't have gains from specialisation.

People should produce goods with lower opportunity costs.

A person will trade with another guy as long as the price of this good is less than the opportunity cost by himself.

The opportunity cost of an activity is the value of the next best alternative activity foregone.

An efficient production point represents a combination of goods for which currently available resources do not allow an increase in the production of one good without a reduction in the production of the other.
All the points on the PPC are efficient.

An unattainable production point represents any combination of goods that cannot be produced with the currently available resources.
All the points that lie outside of the PPC are unattainable.

The fact that the PPC is bowed outward most directly reflects the low-hanging fruit principle.

The low-hanging fruit principle states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Chapter 2
The cost benefit principle states that an action should be taken if the marginal benefit is greater than or equal to the marginal cost.
This applies to both producers and consumers.

Firm in perfect competition profit maximise by producing a quantity where P = MC (marginal revenue equals marginal cost).
Profit can be calculated as quantity*(price-average total cost).

A firm in a perfectly competitive market will earn 0 economic profit if the price is equal to its minimum average total cost.
The marginal cost curve crosses the average total cost curve at its minimum.

A market consists of all the buyers and sellers who are willing to transact a good.
The location of the market is irrelevant in defining the market.

1. TC = FC + VC
2. TC = ATC * Q
3. VC = AVC * Q
4. MC = change in TC/change in Q
5. Revenue = P * Q
6. elasticity = price/quantity * 1/slope

The economic surplus of a certain action is the difference between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost of taking that action.
Using the cost-benefit principle, an agent should take the action as long as the economic surplus is greater than or equal to 0.

The horizontal interpretation is where you start with a price along the vertical axis and move horizontally, increasing quantity until you hit the supply curve.
The horizontal interpretation of the supply curve indicates the number of units a producer is willing to supply at a specific price.

The law of supply is the microeconomic law that states that, all other factors being equal, as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity of goods or services that suppliers offer will increase, and vice versa.

The marginal cost of producing a certain unit of a given good captures the opportunity cost of producing that unit.

We define the marginal cost of producing a certain unit of a given good as the extra cost of producing that unit.

A firm will operate in the short run as long as the market price is greater than or equal to its average variable cost.
However, the firm will exit the market in the long run if the market price is less than its average total cost at the profit-maximising quantity.

In perfect competition, producers and consumers are price takers, meaning they don't have the power to influence market prices.
Any consumer would fail to acquire the good if he were to suggest a lower price.
We also assume that goods are homogenous, meaning that all goods in a single market are identical.
Goods are excludable and rival.
The suppliers and the consumers are perfectly informed regarding the characteristics of the good.
There are no externalities.
Suppilers are free to enter and exit the market.

The producer reservation price is the minimum price a producer is willing to accept offer a certain good or service.

Quantity supplied by a producer is the quantity of the given good or service which will maximise the supplier’s profit at a given market price.

When a firm produces a quantity such that the average variable cost is minimized, 
the marginal cost equals the average variable cost.
The marginal cost curve crosses the average variable and average total cost curves at their minimum.

Short run denotes a period of time during which at least one of the factors of production is fixed.
The long run denotes a period of time during which all factors of production are variable.

The short-run supply curve for a profit maximising firm in a perfectly competitive market is the portion of the firm’s marginal cost curve that lies above the minimum average variable cost curve.

If the unit for calculating price elasticity is decreasing from hundreds to thousands, the price elasticity of supply would decrease.

Firms in perfect competition profit maximise by producing a quantity where P = MC.
Using the vertical interpretation of the supply curve, the price is the minimum amount of money the producer is willing to accept to offer the marginal unit.

A vertical interpretation of the supply curve is where you determine the minimum price the producer is willing to receive (reservation price) for the marginal unit.

## Chapter 3
The consumer reservation price is the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a certain good or service.

The definition of a substitute is that if the price of one good increases, the quantity of the other must increase.

The horizontal interpretation of the demand curve shows how many units a consumer is willing to buy at that price on the demand curve.

Factors that can increase the elasticity of demand:
1. an increase the availability of substitutes
2. a narrowing of the definition of the good
3. an increase in the income share of the good
4. an increase in the time horizon

The quantity demanded represents the quantity of a given good or service that maximizes the utility experienced by the individual consuming it.

Utility is a tool economists used to measure the satisfaction consumers derive from consuming a good.

The income effect captures the changes in the quantity demanded of a given good following a change in the consumer's purchaing poswer.
The substitution effect captures the change in the quantity demanded of a given good following a change in its relative price.

The vertical interpretation of the demand curve starting from a certain quantity and find the associated price on the demand curve.
The price you found indicates the maximum amount of money the consumer is willing to pay for the marginal unit.

## Chapter 4
A shortage means that quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied.

The invisible hand principle holds only if the market is perfectly competitive.

When a perfectly competitive market has reached its equilibrium, the total economic surplus is maximised.

Long run equilibrium is Pareto Efficient, and all possible surplus is captured by consumers and producers.

In the long run, the equilibrium price equals the minimum average total cost.
At this price, firms make exactly 0 economic profit.

The long-run supply curve is perfectly elastic.
In the short run, price fluctuations will occur, and firms will enter/exit the market given the change in profit.
In the long run, the price is stable at the minimum of the average total cost curve.

The market equilibrium outcome is the most efficient possible allocation because at the market equilibrium price, anyone who values a good more than the marginal cost required to produce it will be able to consume it.

In a perfectly competitive market, the market demand curve is a measure of the reservation price of the consumer purchasing the last unit at a given quantity.

When a market is in equilibrium the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded.
There's neither excess supply nor excess demand.

A situation is Pareto efficient if it is possible to make any individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.
Pareto efficient outcomes maximise total surplus, but the relative distribution of this surplus will not impact whether the outcome itself is Pareto efficient.

A Pareto improving transaction is one in which no party is made worse off, and at least one party’s surplus increases.
Pareto improving transactions are only possible if the original outcome does not maximise total surplus, so it is impossible to construct a pareto improving transaction at the competitive market equilibrium which is pareto efficient.

The competitive market equilibrium is Pareto efficient because anything other than they market equilibrium outcome would results in less total surplus, so
someone must be worse off.

## Chapter 5
A binding price ceiling is a maximum allowable price that is below that market equilibrium price.
Consumers find the good more affordable and want to demand more while suppliers find it more costly to produce and will supply less, resulting in an excess demand.

Originally, the supply curve is P = 4 + Q.
Applying a $3 per unit subsidy to pencil producers, the S-SUBSIDY function becomes P = 1 + Q to represent the fall in marginal cost of production.

The effect of the price floor will depend on whether it is binding.
A binding price floor is a minimum allowable price that is set above the competitive market equilibrium price, so that the market price cannot converge to its natural equilibrium where quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded.
On the other hand, if the price floor is set below the competitive market equilibrium price, then it will have no effect whatsoever.

Assuming perfectly competitive markets, the supply and demand curves measure the marginal cost of producing the product and the consumers' reservation price.

If supply is perfectly inelastic, producers will bear the entire tax burden, allowing consumers to see no change in the price they pay following the imposition of the tax.
