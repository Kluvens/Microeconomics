## Chapter 1
Absolute advantage: carry activities with the lowest amount of resources

Comparative advantage: carry activities with lower opportunity costs

If two people have the same opportunity cost, then they don't have gains from specialisation.

People should produce goods with lower opportunity costs.

A person will trade with another guy as long as the price of this good is less than the opportunity cost by himself.

The opportunity cost of an activity is the value of the next best alternative activity foregone.

An efficient production point represents a combination of goods for which currently available resources do not allow an increase in the production of one good without a reduction in the production of the other.
All the points on the PPC are efficient.

An unattainable production point represents any combination of goods that cannot be produced with the currently available resources.
All the points that lie outside of the PPC are unattainable.

The fact that the PPC is bowed outward most directly reflects the low-hanging fruit principle.

The low-hanging fruit principle states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Chapter 2
The cost benefit principle states that an action should be taken if the marginal benefit is greater than or equal to the marginal cost.
This applies to both producers and consumers.

Firm in perfect competition profit maximise by producing a quantity where P = MC.
Profit can be calculated as quantity*(price-average total cost).

A market consists of all the buyers and sellers who are willing to transact a good.
The location of the market is irrelevant in defining the market.
