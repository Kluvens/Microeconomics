## Productive activities
The productive activities are referred to as an activity that contributes to gross domestic product of the country. 
It includes all the transaction that contributes to generation of money income in the economy.

## Productivity
In economics, productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs.

## Time constraint
The time budget constraint states that the sum of the time spent on all activities each day must equal 24 hours.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
The production possibilities curve (PPC) is a graph that shows all of the different combinations of output that can be produced given current resources and technology.

More generally, the PPC captures all maximum output possibilities for two (or more) goods, given a set of inputs (or resources - i.e., time) if inputs are used efficiently.

## Efficient points
We call the points on the PPC efficient points.

## Inefficient points
The points below the PPC, because we did not use the resources efficiently (maybe waste some time doing other things).

## Attainable points
Both efficient and inefficient points are attainable points.

## Unattainable points
The points to the right and above the PPC are called unattainable, because matter what efforts are made, they are not possible to be reached.

## Absolute advantage
An agent (or an economy) has an absolute advantage in a productive activity (like collecting bananas and catching rabits) when he/she can carry on this activity with less resources than another agent.

## Opportunity cost
The oppertunity cost of a given action is defined as the value of the next best alternative to that action.

When calculating opportunity cost, you need to consider the unique direct costs of the action in addition to the value of your next best option.

A simple example calculating the opportunity cost: OC bananas = loss in rabbit / gain in bananas.

## Comparative advantage
An economy has a comparative advantage in a productive activity when he/she has a lower opportunity cost of carrying on that activity than another economy.

## Principle of comparative advantage
The principle of comparative advantage states that everyone is better off if each agent or each country specializes in the activities for which hey have a comparative advantage.

## Specialization
Specialization in economics is the process of an organization concentrating its labor and resources on a certain type of production to be more efficient and create a comparative advantage for an economy.

## The low-hanging fruit principle (or increasing opportuity cost)
The Low-Hanging Fruit Principle (or Increasing Opportunity Cost) states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Consumtpion possibility curve (CPC)
The CPC represents all possible combinations of bananas and rabbits that the economy can feasibly consume when it is open to international trade.

It is important to keep in mind that a change in the international price can change the CPC.
