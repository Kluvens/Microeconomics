## Productive activities
The productive activities are referred to as an activity that contributes to gross domestic product of the country. 
It includes all the transaction that contributes to generation of money income in the economy.

## Productivity
In economics, productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs.

## Time constraint
The time budget constraint states that the sum of the time spent on all activities each day must equal 24 hours.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
The production possibilities curve (PPC) is a graph that shows all of the different combinations of output that can be produced given current resources and technology.

More generally, the PPC captures all maximum output possibilities for two (or more) goods, given a set of inputs (or resources - i.e., time) if inputs are used efficiently.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201515380-872ea4b9-c839-4e7d-a581-2ca657ec181b.png)

## Efficient points
We call the points on the PPC efficient points.

## Inefficient points
The points below the PPC, because we did not use the resources efficiently (maybe waste some time doing other things).

## Attainable points
Both efficient and inefficient points are attainable points.

## Unattainable points
The points to the right and above the PPC are called unattainable, because matter what efforts are made, they are not possible to be reached.

## Absolute advantage
An agent (or an economy) has an absolute advantage in a productive activity (like collecting bananas and catching rabits) when he/she can carry on this activity with less resources than another agent.

## Opportunity cost
The oppertunity cost of a given action is defined as the value of the next best alternative to that action.

When calculating opportunity cost, you need to consider the unique direct costs of the action in addition to the value of your next best option.

A simple example calculating the opportunity cost: OC bananas = loss in rabbit / gain in bananas.

OC of one good = loss in the other good/gain in this good

## Comparative advantage
An economy has a comparative advantage in a productive activity when he/she has a lower opportunity cost of carrying on that activity than another economy.

## Principle of comparative advantage
The principle of comparative advantage states that everyone is better off if each agent or each country specializes in the activities for which hey have a comparative advantage.

## Specialization
Specialization in economics is the process of an organization concentrating its labor and resources on a certain type of production to be more efficient and create a comparative advantage for an economy.

## The low-hanging fruit principle (or increasing opportuity cost)
The Low-Hanging Fruit Principle (or Increasing Opportunity Cost) states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Consumtpion possibility curve (CPC)
The CPC represents all possible combinations of bananas and rabbits that the economy can feasibly consume when it is open to international trade.

It is important to keep in mind that a change in the international price can change the CPC.

## Economy-wide PPC in a Many-Agent Economy
We exhaust the person with lowest opportunity cost and then exhuast the person with the next lowest opportunity cost.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201515497-382c4635-1bcf-413f-9874-befd2e143667.png)

The slope is increasing since the opportunity cost is increasing.

## Sunk Cost
A sunk cost is a cost that once paid cannot be recovered.

An example of sunk cost is the loan.

## Fixed Factor of Production
If a factor of production is fixed, then the cost associated with it does not vary with the quantity produced.

## Fixed Cost
A fixed cost is a cost associated with a fixed factor of production.

## Short Run
short run denotes a period of time during which at least of one factor of production is fixed.

## Variable Factor of Production
If a factor of production is variable, then the cost associated with it tends to vary with the number of units produced.

## Variable Cost
A variable cost is a cost associated with a variable factor of production

## Long Run
long run denotes a period of time during which all factors of production are variable.

## Profit
Profit represents the difference between the total revenues (TR) and the total costs (TC).

## Shut Down Condition (short run)
In the short run, the entrepreneur should shut down production if total production is less than -FC. Otherwise, hte entrepreneur should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## Exit Condition (long run)
In the long run, the entreprenuer should exit the industry if the total production is less than 0. Otherwise, the entreprenuer should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## The production costs in a continuous model

## Shifts of curve
Price will not shift the curve.

Factors shifting the supply curve:
1. technology
2. input prices
3. expectations
4. changes in pricing for other products
5. number of suppliers

Factors shifting the demand curve:
1. change in the taste
2. population
3. income
4. prices of substitute or complement goods
5. expectations

## Price Elasticity of Supply
Price elasticity of supply denotes the precentage change in the quantity supplied resulting from a very small percentage change in price.

Elasticity of A = (quantity change/quantity of A)/(price change/price of A).

Elasticity of A = price of A/quantity of A * 1/slope.

## Law of Supply
Supply curves have the tendency of being upward sloping.

## Elastic Supply
Supply is elastic when the price elasticity of supply is greater than 1.

## Perfectly Elastic Supply
Supply is perfectly elastic if price elasticity of supply is infinte.

## Unit Elastic Supply
Supply is unit elastic when the price elasticity of supply is equal to 1.

## Inelastic Supply
Supply is inelastic when the price elasticity of supply is less than 1.

## Perfectly Inelastic Supply
Supply is perfectly inelastic if price elasticity of supply is zero.

## Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply
factors that could change the elasticity of supply:
1. availability of raw materials
2. factors mobility
3. inventories/excess capacity
4. time horizon

## Determinants of Price Elasticity of Demand
factors that could change the elasticity of demand:
1. availability of substitutes (increase)
2. if the good is a luxury or a necessity
3. the proportion of income spent on the good (sensitive for people belonging to low-income level groups)
4. how much time has elapsed since the time the price changed (the elasticity for a shorter time period is always low or it can even inelastic)

## Inventory
The term invntory refers to the raw materials used in production as well as the goods produced that are available for sale.

## Utility
Utility denotes the satisfaction that an individual derives from consuming a given good or taking a certain action. It is measured in utils per unit of time.

## Decreasing Marginal Utility
Decreasing Marginal Utility implies that the utility from consuming an extra unit of a given good decreases with the number of units that have been previously consumed.

## Quantity Demanded
Quantity Demanded represents the quantity of a given good or service that maximizes the utility experienced by the individual consuming it.

## Giffen Goods
Giffen good is an exception to the law of demand as an increase in price increases the quantity demanded.

## Substitution Effect
The substitution effect captures the change in the quantity demanded of a given good following a change in its relative price.

## Income Effect
The income effect captures the changes in the quantity demanded of a given good following the reduction in the consumer's purchasing power.

## Law of Demand
demand curves have the tendency of being downward sloping

## Demand Curve
Demand curve represents the relationship between the price of a good or service and the quantity demanded of that good or service.

## Horizontal Interpretation of the Demand Curve
Start from a certain price and find the associated quantity on the demand curve. The quantity you found indicates how many units the consumer is willing to buy at that price.

## Vertical Interpretation of the Demand Curve
Start from a certain quantity (say 2 units) and find the associated price on the demand curve. The price you found indicates the maximum amount of money the consumer is willing to pay for the marginal unit (in our example the marginal unit would be the 2nd unit).

## Consumer Reservation Price or Willingness to Pay
Consumer Reservation Price (or Willingness to Pay) denotes the maximum amount of money an individual is willing to pay for a certain good or service.

## Economic Surplus
Economic surplus refers to the respective gains that a consumer or producer gets within an economic activity and is the combined benefit, sometimes referred to as "total welfare."

## Total Consumer Surplus
Total Consumer Surplus represents the sum of the economic surplus of all consumers.

## Total Producer Surplus
Total Producer Surplus represents the sum of the economic surplus of all producers.

## Total Surplus
Total surplus is the sum of all economic surplus generated by a market.

## Pareto Efficiency
Pareto Efficiency is an outcome situation in which it is impossible to make any individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.

## Pareto Improving Transaction
A Pareto Improving Transaction is a transaction where all parties involved are better off.

## The Invisible Hand Principle
The invisible hand principle states that individuals independent efforts to maximise their gains will generally be beneficial for society and result in the socially optimal allocation of resources.

## Price Ceiling
The price ceiling represents a maximum allowable price imposed by the government.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201518875-9fe83732-0727-456e-a0ba-a82268aab487.png)

## Deadweight Loss
The Deadweight Loss is the loss in economic surplus due to the market being prevented from reaching the equilibrium price and quantity where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.

## Price Floor
The Price Floor represents a minimum allowable price imposed by the government.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201518927-6269e63c-adc3-4589-8322-40a276dc0489.png)

## Taxation
Governments often set taxes to improve the distribution of income and opportunities across different population groups. Unlike the price ceiling and the price floor, a tax generates tax revenues that can be used to redistribute wealth within a society.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201519001-fb06ce3a-c146-44e7-8989-de158581bc81.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201519034-402cb41c-3011-40be-8ceb-ed32e9365ccf.png)

## Subsidy
A subsidy or government incentive is a form of financial aid or support extended to an economic sector (business, or individual) generally with the aim of promoting economic and social policy.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201519328-551eead3-892b-4ea7-8e3a-b6ba05d9dae7.png)

## Closed Economy
it is an economy that does not engage in international trade.
Also known as autarky.

## Open Economy
it is an economy taht engages in international trade.

## Gains from Trade
It captures the extra total surplus available in an open economy situation compared to a closed economy.

These gains from trade come from international consumers who have a relatively high demand for our rabbits.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201504356-6e99b4e7-d7d7-4f20-b732-90a11425721c.png)

The pink area is the increase of total surplus.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201504413-64efdf29-a786-4e18-989e-4937b2565389.png)

This pink area also indicates the gains from trade (increase of total surplus).

## Winners and Losers from International Trade
Domestic consumers lose surplus when their country starts to export the good in question and domestic producers lose surplus when their country starts to import.

So the consumers in the first case or the producers in the second case may lobby the government to restrict free trade.

Because the gains from trade are often thinly spread over many consumers but the losses are felt strongly by a small group of producers (domestic producers).

## Trade Restrictions
They are artificial restrictions on the trade of goods and/or services between two countries.
It is the byproduct of protectionism.

## Protectionism
It is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, import quotas, and a variaty of other government regulations.

## Import Tariff
It represents a tax on imported goods or services.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201505967-3bdccec7-0ba8-4369-9f33-2a716b5e44c7.png)

The green area is the gains of domestic producers and pink area is the revenues of the government.

The consumer surplus would decrease by area H+I+J+K, and producer surplus would increase by H.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201506008-598409d2-4115-4e75-ac12-193ee71eb0ae.png)

The pink areas are deadweight losses.

## Deadweight Loss
It is a cost to society created by market inefficiently, which occurs when supply and demand are out of equilibrium.

## Imported Quota
It represents a quantity limit on the amount of goods or service permitted to be imported.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201506180-0f007277-2fa3-48ce-8bba-1ea55f661006.png)

The total supply curve would shift to the right as there are some imported goods.
Then the equilibrium price would decrease.

The areas of surplus affected are the same as tariff.
However, the revenue earned by the government now would flow to the importing agents.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has asked its members to convert their trade restrictions from quotas to tariffs because there is less transparency in how the surplus from a quota is distributed.

## Price Makers
It is a seller that has enough market and pricing power to influence prices within the market.
In such a case, market and pricing power is determined by the ability of a business to change the prices of products and services effectively.

## Price Takers
A price taker is an individual or company that must accept prevailing prices in a market, lacking the market share to influence market price on its own.

Due to market competition, most producers are also price-takers.

## Market Power
A firm has market power if it has the ability to set its own price.

A firm with market power can change their price to some extent without losing all their consumers.
This means that the demand curve they face is not perfectly elastic (horizontal);
rather, it must be downward sloping.

## Imperfectly Competitive Market
Is a market where that at least one of the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market fails to be satisfied.

There are three main forms of imperfectly competitive markets:
1. Monopoly
2. Monopolistic competition
3. Oligopolistic competition

## Monopoly
There is only one firm in the market. Hence, the firm’s individual demand curve coincides with the market demand curve. 
One of the most famous example of monopoly is Microsoft and its most notorious operating system Windows, which is essentially the only operating system in the whole market for personal computers.

## Monopolistic Competition
There is a large number of firms, each producing a slightly differentiated product. One example is the restaurant industry. 
An Italian restaurant offers a similar product compared to a Japanese restaurant (i.e., food), but they don’t offer exactly the same type of food. 
This provides a measure of market power, where the Italian restaurant can increase the price without losing all its sales because Italian and Japanese food are not perfect substitutes. 
Another example is the competitive structure in which petrol stations operate. 
At first glance, it appears that every petrol station sells the same product — petrol. However, each one has a different location and some of them offer special services like car-wash facilities and bars. This differentiates the service they offer. 
If the petrol station located in the vicinity of your home increases its price, you might continue to go there because driving to the next one might not be worth the effort.

## Oligopolistic Competition
There is a small number of firms that sell goods that are close substitutes. 
In Australia, there are several examples of this form of market structure. 
The media outlet industry (dominated by News Corporation, Time Warner and Fairfax Media), the grocery retailing (dominated by Coles Group and Woolworths) and the banking sector (dominated by ANZ, Westpac, NAB, and Commonwealth Bank). 
In the United States, the movie industry is dominated by six major studios who receive almost the entirety of American film revenues.

## Invisible Hand Principle
The invisible hand principle suggests a simple mechanism that eliminates market power:
whenever firms make profits, some new firms will be willing to enter the market and commence production of the same good.
The entry process will continue until the firms in the market make 0 profit and are essentially left with no market power.

## Barriers to entry
Barriers to entry is an economics and business term describing factors that can prevent or impede newcomers into a market or industry sector, and so limit competition.

Some major barriers to entry:
1. Control over scare resources
2. Government-created barriers to entry
3. Increasing returns to scale
4. Network economies

## Increasing Returns to Scale
There are increasing returns to scale when the average total cost of producing a certain good decreases with the amount of the good produced.

## Network Economies
Also called the network effect, is the phenomenon by which the value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products.

## Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly denotes a monopoly that occurs because of increasing returns to scale.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201508023-f440ce3e-7852-4d5d-84c6-bb75da0b1ec0.png)

## Monopoly
Monopoly is a market structure where there is only one firm operating in the market.

The profit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost: that is, MR = MC.

The monopolist will continue to produce as long as the marginal revenue is at least as large as the marginal cost. That is, MR >= MC.

To reach the socially optimal level of output, the monopolist must produce as long as P >= MC.

The deadweight loss in monopoly:

The monopolist maximizes profit by equating marginal revenue with marginal cost.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201509041-fca113cc-4130-4ec2-a9ff-71a716fe324d.png)

## Competition Law
Competition Law denotes laws intended to foster market competition by regulating the anti-competitive conduct of firms.

## Average Cost Pricing
The Average Cost Pricing denotes a policy through which the government forces the monopolist to set the price and quantity at the intersection of the ATCATC curve and the demand curve.

However, average cost pricing is hard to implement because:
1. government does not know the ATCATC, it can only estimate them,
2. once this policy is in place, firms have no incentive to invest in new technology to lower their production costs — they make zero profit either way,
3. when the government uses average cost pricing, the firm’s output is allocatively inefficient. This is due to the fact that the price usually exceeds the marginal cost.

## Allocatively Inefficient
A firm’s output is said to be Allocatively Inefficient if the price asked for the goods produced exceeds their marginal cost.

## First Degree Price Discrimination
First degree price discrimination describes a situation in which the monopolist knows the reservation price of each consumer and is able to charge each consumer his marginal benefit.

## Reservation Price
it is the minimum amount that a seller will accept as the winning bid.
Alternatively, it is less commonly known as the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a good or service.

## Second Degree Price Discrimination
Second-degree price discrimination involves charging consumers a different price for the amount or quantity consumed.

## Third Degree Price Discrimination
Third-degree price discrimination occurs when a company charges a different price to different consumer groups. 
For example, a theater may divide moviegoers into seniors, adults, and children, each paying a different price when seeing the same movie. This discrimination is the most common.

## Oligopoly
oligopoly markets are markets dominated by a small number of suppliers.

## Game Theory
it is a branch of applied mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent.

## Dominant Strategy
No matter what the other palyer is doing, this strategy is always better than other strategies that I can do.

## Acting rationally
each player wants to maximise its profits

## Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies
it is solution concept that involves iteratively removing strategies that are not dominant.

## Prisoner's Dilemma Game
it is a type of game where firms might decide not to cooperate even though doing so would be benenficial to both of them.

Both players may have the same dominant strategy.

## Cartel Game
A cartel is aimed at increasing the profit of the cartel members by reducing competition in the market.
A cartel agreement achieves this objective by controlling prices or by preventing new competitors from entering the market.

Usually cartel is illegal and is prohibited under competition law - 
a law that is intended to foster market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by firms.
The final objective of this type of legislation is to ensure that consumers are charged the lowest possible prices.

## Anti-trust
antitrust refers to the regulation of the concentration of economic power, particularly in regard to monopolies and other anticompetitive practices.

## Coordination Game
It is a type of game that captures those situations where the players benefit from coordinating their decisions.

There are no dominant strategies.

It describes the situation where a player will earn a higher payoff when they select the same course of action as another player.

In coordination game, there are two or more nash equilibriums.

## Strategy Profile
it denotes a set of strategies, one for each player.
The payoffs corresponding to each strategy profile are presented in cells.

## Nash Equilibrium
A strategy profile is a Nash Equilibrium if no player can benefit from unilaterally changing her strategy.

## Externalities
Externalities refers to situations when the effect of production or consumption of goods and services imposes costs or benefits on others which are not reflected in the prices charged for the goods and services being provided.

There are four different types of externalities:
- positive consumption
- positive production
- negative consumption
- negative production

## Positive Consumption Externality
It represents a benefit accrued to someone who is not involved in the consumption of a given good.

Examples of positive consumption externality:
1. fitness activities - reduce health care costs
2. vaccinations
3. bike to work - reduce traffic congestion and pollution
4. social networking - happiness
5. fire protection services - reduce likelihood to spread fire to other homes

## Coase Theorem
If trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs, bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights.

## Negative Production Externality
It represents a cost incurred by someone who is not involved in the production of a given good.

Examples of negative production externality:
1. harmful production activities - inadequate technologies can impose pollution
2. excessive risk-taking - can kickstart global financial crises
3. over-fishing - by engaging in over-fishing, firms run the risk of depleting the stock of fish in the ocean

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201511916-6ae3cc66-08d4-4b94-b1eb-874aad354071.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201511975-f3696622-80ef-41ae-877d-a2831b041ee8.png)

## Negative Consumption Externality
A Negative Consumption Externality represents a cost incurred by someone who is not involved in the consumption of a given good.

Examples of negative consumption externality:
1. smoking
2. alcohol abuse
3. driving

## Positive Production Externality
A Positive Production Externality represents a benefit accrued to someone who is not involved in the production of a given good.

Examples of positive production externality:
1. beneficial production activities: 
2. new production technologies
3. on-the-job training

## Social supply
If a firm is forced to pay its additional externality costs, production becomes more costly, and the social supply curve will shift up.

## Private supply
The private supply curve invorporates less costs.

## Privatization
It occurs when a government-owned business, operation, or property becomes owned by a private, non-government party.

## Pure Public Goods
Pure public goods represent goods that are perfectly non-rivalrous and non-excludable.

## Non-rivalry
one individual's consumption of the good does not impede another individual from consuming it as well;
the marginal cost of providing the public good to an additional individual is equal to 0.

## Non-Excludability
No one can be excluded from consuming the good

## Impure Public Goods
Impure public goods represent goods that are non-rivalrous and non-excludable only up to a point.

## Marginal Social Benefit
The marginal Social Benefit is the vertical sum of the individual marginal benefits.

## Samuelson Condition
The samuelson condition states that the efficient quantity of a public good is found by setting the sum of the individual marginal benefits equal to the marginal cost.

## Free market
A free market is an economic system in which the prices of goods and services are determined by supply and demand expressed by sellers and buyers.

## Free-Riding
Free-riding denotes the action of enjoying a good without paying for it.
The free-riding problem is caused by the non-exludable nature of public goods and it results in their under-provision.

## Lindahl Prices Structure
Lindahl Prices imply that each individual pays for the provision of a public good according to their marginal benefit.

## Public Goods and Externalities
A public good is an extreme case of positive externality.

Like with a positive externality, no one can be excluded from benefiting from the good.
By extreme case, we mean that, unlike a standard externality, the benefit accrued to those who enjoy the public good does not depend on who is providing it; indeed, this is another way of defining non-rivalry.

## Economies of Scale
economies of scale are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, and are typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of time.

## Diseconomies of Scale
diseconomies of scale are the cost disadvantages that economic actors accrue due to an increase in organizational size or in output, resulting in production of goods and services at increased per-unit costs.

## Capital
capital goods or capital are "those durable produced goods that are in turn used as productive inputs for further production" of goods and services.

## Capital Intensive
business processes or industries that require large amounts of investment to produce a good or service and thus have a high percentage of fixed assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).

Companies in capital-intensive industries are often marked by high levels of depreciation.

## Consumer Sovereignty
Consumer sovereignty is the economic concept that the consumer has some controlling power over goods that are produced, and the idea that the consumer is the best judge of their own welfare.

It also refers to the freedom of consumers to make their own decisions about which goods and services to buy.

## Enterprise
any entity engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form.

## Fair Return Price
Price is equal to its average total cost, which results in a normal profit.

## Inferior Goods
An inferior good is an economic term that describes a good whose demand drops when people's incomes rise.

## Market Concentration
market concentration is a function of the number of firms and their respective shares of the total production (alternatively, total capacity or total reserves) in a market.

## Normal Profit
Normal profit is an economic term that refers to a situation where the total revenues of a company are equal to the total costs in a perfectly competitive market.

## Formulas
Marginal Cost = change of Total Cost / change of Total Quantity

Variable Cost = Total Cost - Fixed Cost

Average Variable Cost = Variable Cost / total quantity

Average Total Cost = Total cost / total quantity

In the long run to make sure the business is still open, the price has to be at least average total cost.

In the short run to make sure the business is open, the price has to be at least average variable cost.
