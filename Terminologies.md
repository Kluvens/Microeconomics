## Productive activities
The productive activities are referred to as an activity that contributes to gross domestic product of the country. 
It includes all the transaction that contributes to generation of money income in the economy.

## Productivity
In economics, productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs.

## Time constraint
The time budget constraint states that the sum of the time spent on all activities each day must equal 24 hours.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
The production possibilities curve (PPC) is a graph that shows all of the different combinations of output that can be produced given current resources and technology.

More generally, the PPC captures all maximum output possibilities for two (or more) goods, given a set of inputs (or resources - i.e., time) if inputs are used efficiently.

## Efficient points
We call the points on the PPC efficient points.

## Inefficient points
The points below the PPC, because we did not use the resources efficiently (maybe waste some time doing other things).

## Attainable points
Both efficient and inefficient points are attainable points.

## Unattainable points
The points to the right and above the PPC are called unattainable, because matter what efforts are made, they are not possible to be reached.

## Absolute advantage
An agent (or an economy) has an absolute advantage in a productive activity (like collecting bananas and catching rabits) when he/she can carry on this activity with less resources than another agent.

## Opportunity cost
The oppertunity cost of a given action is defined as the value of the next best alternative to that action.

When calculating opportunity cost, you need to consider the unique direct costs of the action in addition to the value of your next best option.

A simple example calculating the opportunity cost: OC bananas = loss in rabbit / gain in bananas.

## Comparative advantage
An economy has a comparative advantage in a productive activity when he/she has a lower opportunity cost of carrying on that activity than another economy.

## Principle of comparative advantage
The principle of comparative advantage states that everyone is better off if each agent or each country specializes in the activities for which hey have a comparative advantage.

## Specialization
Specialization in economics is the process of an organization concentrating its labor and resources on a certain type of production to be more efficient and create a comparative advantage for an economy.

## The low-hanging fruit principle (or increasing opportuity cost)
The Low-Hanging Fruit Principle (or Increasing Opportunity Cost) states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Consumtpion possibility curve (CPC)
The CPC represents all possible combinations of bananas and rabbits that the economy can feasibly consume when it is open to international trade.

It is important to keep in mind that a change in the international price can change the CPC.

## Sunk Cost
A sunk cost is a cost that once paid cannot be recovered.

An example of sunk cost is the loan.

## Fixed Factor of Production
If a factor of production is fixed, then the cost associated with it does not vary with the quantity produced.

## Fixed Cost
A fixed cost is a cost associated with a fixed factor of production.

## Short Run
short run denotes a period of time during which at least of one factor of production is fixed.

## Variable Factor of Production
If a factor of production is variable, then the cost associated with it tends to vary with the number of units produced.

## Variable Cost
A variable cost is a cost associated with a variable factor of production

## Long Run
long run denotes a period of time during which all factors of production are variable.

## Profit
Profit represents the difference between the total revenues (TR) and the total costs (TC).

## Shut Down Condition (short run)
In the short run, the entrepreneur should shut down production if total production is less than -FC. Otherwise, hte entrepreneur should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## Exit Condition (long run)
In the long run, the entreprenuer should exit the industry if the total production is less than 0. Otherwise, the entreprenuer should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## Closed Economy
it is an economy that does not engage in international trade.
Also known as autarky.

## Open Economy
it is an economy taht engages in international trade.

## Gains from Trade
It captures the extra total surplus available in an open economy situation compared to a closed economy.

These gains from trade come from international consumers who have a relatively high demand for our rabbits.

The pink area is the increase of total surplus.

This pink area also indicates the gains from trade (increase of total surplus).

## Winners and Losers from International Trade
Domestic consumers lose surplus when their country starts to export the good in question and domestic producers lose surplus when their country starts to import.

So the consumers in the first case or the producers in the second case may lobby the government to restrict free trade.

Because the gains from trade are often thinly spread over many consumers but the losses are felt strongly by a small group of producers (domestic producers).

## Trade Restrictions
They are artificial restrictions on the trade of goods and/or services between two countries.
It is the byproduct of protectionism.

## Protectionism
It is the economic policy of restricting imports from other countries through methods such as tariffs on imported goods, import quotas, and a variaty of other government regulations.

## Import Tariff
It represents a tax on imported goods or services.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201505967-3bdccec7-0ba8-4369-9f33-2a716b5e44c7.png)

The green area is the gains of domestic producers and pink area is the revenues of the government.

The consumer surplus would decrease by area H+I+J+K, and producer surplus would increase by H.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201506008-598409d2-4115-4e75-ac12-193ee71eb0ae.png)

The pink areas are deadweight losses.

## Deadweight Loss
It is a cost to society created by market inefficiently, which occurs when supply and demand are out of equilibrium.

## Imported Quota
It represents a quantity limit on the amount of goods or service permitted to be imported.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95273765/201506180-0f007277-2fa3-48ce-8bba-1ea55f661006.png)

The total supply curve would shift to the right as there are some imported goods.
Then the equilibrium price would decrease.

The areas of surplus affected are the same as tariff.
However, the revenue earned by the government now would flow to the importing agents.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) has asked its members to convert their trade restrictions from quotas to tariffs because there is less transparency in how the surplus from a quota is distributed.

## Price Makers
It is a seller that has enough market and pricing power to influence prices within the market.
In such a case, market and pricing power is determined by the ability of a business to change the prices of products and services effectively.

## Price Takers
A price taker is an individual or company that must accept prevailing prices in a market, lacking the market share to influence market price on its own.

Due to market competition, most producers are also price-takers.

## Market Power
A firm has market power if it has the ability to set its own price.

A firm with market power can change their price to some extent without losing all their consumers.
This means that the demand curve they face is not perfectly elastic (horizontal);
rather, it must be downward sloping.

## Imperfectly Competitive Market
Is a market where that at least one of the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market fails to be satisfied.

There are three main forms of imperfectly competitive markets:
1. Monopoly
2. Monopolistic competition
3. Oligopolistic competition

## Monopoly
There is only one firm in the market. Hence, the firm’s individual demand curve coincides with the market demand curve. 
One of the most famous example of monopoly is Microsoft and its most notorious operating system Windows, which is essentially the only operating system in the whole market for personal computers.

## Monopolistic Competition
There is a large number of firms, each producing a slightly differentiated product. One example is the restaurant industry. 
An Italian restaurant offers a similar product compared to a Japanese restaurant (i.e., food), but they don’t offer exactly the same type of food. 
This provides a measure of market power, where the Italian restaurant can increase the price without losing all its sales because Italian and Japanese food are not perfect substitutes. 
Another example is the competitive structure in which petrol stations operate. 
At first glance, it appears that every petrol station sells the same product — petrol. However, each one has a different location and some of them offer special services like car-wash facilities and bars. This differentiates the service they offer. 
If the petrol station located in the vicinity of your home increases its price, you might continue to go there because driving to the next one might not be worth the effort.

## Oligopolistic Competition
There is a small number of firms that sell goods that are close substitutes. 
In Australia, there are several examples of this form of market structure. 
The media outlet industry (dominated by News Corporation, Time Warner and Fairfax Media), the grocery retailing (dominated by Coles Group and Woolworths) and the banking sector (dominated by ANZ, Westpac, NAB, and Commonwealth Bank). 
In the United States, the movie industry is dominated by six major studios who receive almost the entirety of American film revenues.

## Invisible Hand Principle
The invisible hand principle suggests a simple mechanism that eliminates market power:
whenever firms make profits, some new firms will be willing to enter the market and commence production of the same good.
The entry process will continue until the firms in the market make 0 profit and are essentially left with no market power.

## Barriers to entry
Barriers to entry is an economics and business term describing factors that can prevent or impede newcomers into a market or industry sector, and so limit competition.

Some major barriers to entry:
1. Control over scare resources
2. Government-created barriers to entry
3. Increasing returns to scale
4. Network economies

## Increasing Returns to Scale
There are increasing returns to scale when the average total cost of producing a certain good decreases with the amount of the good produced.

## Network Economies
Also called the network effect, is the phenomenon by which the value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of users of compatible products.

## Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly denotes a monopoly that occurs because of increasing returns to scale.

## Monopoly
Monopoly is a market structure where there is only one firm operating in the market.

The profit-maximizing choice for the monopoly will be to produce at the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost: that is, MR = MC.

The monopolist will continue to produce as long as the marginal revenue is at least as large as the marginal cost. That is, MR >= MC.

To reach the socially optimal level of output, the monopolist must produce as long as P >= MC.

The deadweight loss in monopoly:

## Oligopoly
oligopoly markets are markets dominated by a small number of suppliers.

## Game Theory
it is a branch of applied mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent.

## Dominant Strategy
No matter what the other palyer is doing, this strategy is always better than other strategies that I can do.

## Acting rationally
each player wants to maximise its profits

## Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies
it is solution concept that involves iteratively removing strategies that are not dominant.

## Prisoner's Dilemma Game
it is a type of game where firms might decide not to cooperate even though doing so would be benenficial to both of them.

Both players may have the same dominant strategy.

## Cartel Game
A cartel is aimed at increasing the profit of the cartel members by reducing competition in the market.
A cartel agreement achieves this objective by controlling prices or by preventing new competitors from entering the market.

Usually cartel is illegal and is prohibited under competition law - 
a law that is intended to foster market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by firms.
The final objective of this type of legislation is to ensure that consumers are charged the lowest possible prices.

## Anti-trust
antitrust refers to the regulation of the concentration of economic power, particularly in regard to monopolies and other anticompetitive practices.

## Coordination Game
It is a type of game that captures those situations where the players benefit from coordinating their decisions.

There are no dominant strategies.

It describes the situation where a player will earn a higher payoff when they select the same course of action as another player.

In coordination game, there are two or more nash equilibriums.

## Strategy Profile
it denotes a set of strategies, one for each player.
The payoffs corresponding to each strategy profile are presented in cells.

## Nash Equilibrium
A strategy profile is a Nash Equilibrium if no player can benefit from unilaterally changing her strategy.

## Formulas
Marginal Cost = change of Total Cost / change of Total Quantity

Variable Cost = Total Cost - Fixed Cost

Average Variable Cost = Variable Cost / total quantity

Average Total Cost = Total cost / total quantity

In the long run to make sure the business is still open, the price has to be at least average total cost.

In the short run to make sure the business is open, the price has to be at least average variable cost.
