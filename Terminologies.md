## Productive activities
The productive activities are referred to as an activity that contributes to gross domestic product of the country. 
It includes all the transaction that contributes to generation of money income in the economy.

## Productivity
In economics, productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs.

## Time constraint
The time budget constraint states that the sum of the time spent on all activities each day must equal 24 hours.

## Production Possibility Curve (PPC)
The production possibilities curve (PPC) is a graph that shows all of the different combinations of output that can be produced given current resources and technology.

More generally, the PPC captures all maximum output possibilities for two (or more) goods, given a set of inputs (or resources - i.e., time) if inputs are used efficiently.

## Efficient points
We call the points on the PPC efficient points.

## Inefficient points
The points below the PPC, because we did not use the resources efficiently (maybe waste some time doing other things).

## Attainable points
Both efficient and inefficient points are attainable points.

## Unattainable points
The points to the right and above the PPC are called unattainable, because matter what efforts are made, they are not possible to be reached.

## Absolute advantage
An agent (or an economy) has an absolute advantage in a productive activity (like collecting bananas and catching rabits) when he/she can carry on this activity with less resources than another agent.

## Opportunity cost
The oppertunity cost of a given action is defined as the value of the next best alternative to that action.

When calculating opportunity cost, you need to consider the unique direct costs of the action in addition to the value of your next best option.

A simple example calculating the opportunity cost: OC bananas = loss in rabbit / gain in bananas.

## Comparative advantage
An economy has a comparative advantage in a productive activity when he/she has a lower opportunity cost of carrying on that activity than another economy.

## Principle of comparative advantage
The principle of comparative advantage states that everyone is better off if each agent or each country specializes in the activities for which hey have a comparative advantage.

## Specialization
Specialization in economics is the process of an organization concentrating its labor and resources on a certain type of production to be more efficient and create a comparative advantage for an economy.

## The low-hanging fruit principle (or increasing opportuity cost)
The Low-Hanging Fruit Principle (or Increasing Opportunity Cost) states that in the process of increasing the production of any good, one first employs those resources with the lowest opportunity cost and only once these are exhausted turn to resources with higher cost.

## Consumtpion possibility curve (CPC)
The CPC represents all possible combinations of bananas and rabbits that the economy can feasibly consume when it is open to international trade.

It is important to keep in mind that a change in the international price can change the CPC.

## Sunk Cost
A sunk cost is a cost that once paid cannot be recovered.

An example of sunk cost is the loan.

## Fixed Factor of Production
If a factor of production is fixed, then the cost associated with it does not vary with the quantity produced.

## Fixed Cost
A fixed cost is a cost associated with a fixed factor of production.

## Short Run
short run denotes a period of time during which at least of one factor of production is fixed.

## Variable Factor of Production
If a factor of production is variable, then the cost associated with it tends to vary with the number of units produced.

## Variable Cost
A variable cost is a cost associated with a variable factor of production

## Long Run
long run denotes a period of time during which all factors of production are variable.

## Profit
Profit represents the difference between the total revenues (TR) and the total costs (TC).

## Shut Down Condition (short run)
In the short run, the entrepreneur should shut down production if total production is less than -FC. Otherwise, hte entrepreneur should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## Exit Condition (long run)
In the long run, the entreprenuer should exit the industry if the total production is less than 0. Otherwise, the entreprenuer should hire the optimal number of workers and continue operations.

## Oligopoly
oligopoly markets are markets dominated by a small number of suppliers.

## Game Theory
it is a branch of applied mathematics that provides tools for analyzing situations in which parties, called players, make decisions that are interdependent.

## Dominant Strategy
No matter what the other palyer is doing, this strategy is always better than other strategies that I can do.

## Acting rationally
each player wants to maximise its profits

## Iterated Elimination of Dominated Strategies
it is solution concept that involves iteratively removing strategies that are not dominant.

## Prisoner's Dilemma Game
it is a type of game where firms might decide not to cooperate even though doing so would be benenficial to both of them.

Both players may have the same dominant strategy.

## Cartel Game
A cartel is aimed at increasing the profit of the cartel members by reducing competition in the market.
A cartel agreement achieves this objective by controlling prices or by preventing new competitors from entering the market.

Usually cartel is illegal and is prohibited under competition law - 
a law that is intended to foster market competition by regulating anti-competitive conduct by firms.
The final objective of this type of legislation is to ensure that consumers are charged the lowest possible prices.

## Anti-trust
antitrust refers to the regulation of the concentration of economic power, particularly in regard to monopolies and other anticompetitive practices.

## Coordination Game
It is a type of game that captures those situations where the players benefit from coordinating their decisions.

There are no dominant strategies.

It describes the situation where a player will earn a higher payoff when they select the same course of action as another player.

In coordination game, there are two or more nash equilibriums.

## Strategy Profile
it denotes a set of strategies, one for each player.
The payoffs corresponding to each strategy profile are presented in cells.

## Nash Equilibrium
A strategy profile is a Nash Equilibrium if no player can benefit from unilaterally changing her strategy.

## Formulas
Marginal Cost = change of Total Cost / change of Total Quantity

Variable Cost = Total Cost - Fixed Cost

Average Variable Cost = Variable Cost / total quantity

Average Total Cost = Total cost / total quantity

In the long run to make sure the business is still open, the price has to be at least average total cost.

In the short run to make sure the business is open, the price has to be at least average variable cost.
